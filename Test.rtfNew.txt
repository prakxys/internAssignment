\
here is a short description of _the_ plugin.  this should be no more than 150 characters.  no markup here.\
\
== description ==\
\
this is _the_ long description.  no limit, and you can use markdown (as well as in _the_ following sections).\
\
for backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, _the_ full length of _the_ short description will be used, and\
markdown parsed.\
\
a few notes about _the_ sections above:\
\
*   "contributors" is a comma separated list of wordpress.org usernames\
*   "tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to _the_ plugin\
*   "requires at least" is _the_ lowest version that _the_ plugin will work on\
*   "tested up to" is _the_ highest version that you've *successfully used to test _the_ plugin*. note that it might work on\
higher versions... this is just _the_ highest one you've verified.\
*   stable tag should indicate _the_ subversion "tag" of _the_ latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for\
stable.\
\
    note that _the_ `readme.txt` of _the_ stable tag is _the_ one that is considered _the_ defining one for _the_ plugin, so\
if _the_ `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that _the_ stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used\
for displaying information about _the_ plugin.  in this situation, _the_ only thing considered from _the_ trunk `readme.txt`\
is _the_ stable tag pointer.  thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update _the_ trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in\
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about _the_ current stable version\
that lacks those changes -- as long as _the_ trunk's `readme.txt` points to _the_ correct stable tag.\
\
    if no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where\
you put _the_ stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.\
\
== installation ==\
\
this section describes how to install _the_ plugin and get it working.\
\
e.g.\
\
1. upload _the_ plugin files to _the_ `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install _the_ plugin through _the_ wordpress plugins screen directly.\
1. activate _the_ plugin through _the_ 'plugins' screen in wordpress\
1. use _the_ settings->plugin name screen to configure _the_ plugin\
1. (make your instructions match _the_ desired user flow for activating and installing your plugin. include any steps that might be needed for explanatory purposes)\
\
\
== frequently asked questions ==\
\
= a question that someone might have =\
\
an answer to that question.\
\
= what about foo bar? =\
\
answer to foo bar dilemma.\
\
== screenshots ==\
\
1. this screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). note that _the_ screenshot is taken from\
_the_ /assets directory or _the_ directory that contains _the_ stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). screenshots in _the_ /assets \
directory take precedence. for example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` \
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).\
2. this is _the_ second screen shot\
\
== changelog ==\
\
= 1.0 =\
* a change since _the_ previous version.\
* another change.\
\
= 0.5 =\
* list versions from most recent at top to oldest at bottom.\
\
== upgrade notice ==\
\
= 1.0 =\
upgrade notices describe _the_ reason a user should upgrade.  no more than 300 characters.\
\
= 0.5 =\
this version fixes a security related bug.  upgrade immediately.\
\
== arbitrary section ==\
\
you may provide arbitrary sections, in _the_ same format as _the_ ones above.  this may be of use for extremely complicated\
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into _the_ categories of "description" or\
"installation."  arbitrary sections will be shown below _the_ built-in sections outlined above.\
\
== a brief markdown example ==\
\
ordered list:\
\
1. some feature\
1. another feature\
1. something else about _the_ plugin\
\
unordered list:\
\
* something\
* something else\
* third thing\
\
here's a link to [wordpress](http://wordpress.org/ "your favorite software") and one to [markdown's syntax documentation][markdown syntax].\
titles are optional, naturally.\
\
[markdown syntax]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\
            "markdown is what _the_ parser uses to process much of _the_ readme file"\
\
markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and i've been told:\
> asterisks for *emphasis*. double it up  for **strong**.\
\
`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`}
